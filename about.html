    <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div>
    <p>
    I graduated from Western University with a major in <strong>Physical Geography
    and the Environment</strong>, where I developed a strong foundation in spatial
    thinking, environmental analysis, and geographic problem-solving.
    I am currently enrolled in a <strong>postgraduate Geographic Information
    Systems (GIS) certification program</strong>, where I am expanding my technical
    skills in <em>geospatial analysis</em>, data management, and web-based mapping
    applications.
</p>

<p>
    My academic and professional interests include <em>environmental analysis</em>,
    urban planning, spatial data acquisition, remote sensing, and effective
    management of geospatial data. I am particularly interested in how GIS
    and <strong>WebGIS technologies</strong> can be used to support informed
    decision-making related to environmental sustainability and urban development.
</p>

<p>
    Outside of academics, I am an outdoor-oriented individual who enjoys
    exploring natural environments and understanding landscapes through
    both field experience and spatial data. This combination of technical
    training and personal interest in the environment motivates my pursuit
    of a career in <strong>GIS and WebGIS development</strong>, where I aim to create
    meaningful, <em>data-driven solutions</em> to real-world challenges.
