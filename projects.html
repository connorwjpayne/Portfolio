        <h2>Road Asset Data Completeness Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            This self-directed project evaluated municipal road asset data using
            Oxford County road centerline open data. The project focused on schema
            design, attribute completeness analysis, and inspection prioritization
            using traffic volume data. A Survey123 inspection form was developed
            to support future field data collection workflows.

        <h2>Community Asset Condition Analysis – Old East Village</h2>
        <p>
            An academic GIS project involving field data collection using Survey123
            and mobile GIS tools. Community assets were evaluated based on visibility,
            condition, and community involvement. Results were presented through an
            ArcGIS StoryMap and Dashboard for non-technical audiences.

        <h2>Train Derailment Emergency Evacuation Model</h2>
        <p>
            Developed a GIS-based evacuation model for a simulated train derailment
            scenario using buffer analysis, population data, and transit routes.
            The project identified evacuation corridors and safe zones for emergency
            planning and public communication.

        <h2>Vehicle Collision Hotspot Analysis – Toronto</h2>
        <p>
            Analyzed multi-year collision data to identify spatial and temporal
            hotspots in downtown Toronto. The project supported safer commuter
            route awareness through thematic mapping and spatial analysis.

        <h3>Flood Risk Assessment – Western University Campus</h3>
        <p>
            Conducted a flood risk assessment by analyzing multiple water-level
            scenarios and elevation surfaces to identify high-risk and safe zones.
            Developed a 3D campus visualization using ArcGIS Pro to communicate
            flood impacts clearly.

        <h3>Westminster Ponds Water Content & Health Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Collected sediment cores to evaluate historical pond conditions and
            measured pH, dissolved oxygen, and salinity using a DO meter. Results
            were presented as an academic poster displayed at the Westminster
            Ponds Centre for Tourism.

        <h3>Medway River System Field Measurements</h3>
        <p>
            Conducted hydrological field measurements including discharge, velocity,
            depth, and gradient, emphasizing accurate data collection and teamwork
            in a real-world river system.
